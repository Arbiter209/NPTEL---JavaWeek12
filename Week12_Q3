/*Write a program to create a record by taking inputs using Scanner class as first name as string ,last name as string ,roll number 
as integer ,subject1 mark as float,subject2 mark as float. Your program should print in the format 
  "name  rollnumber avgmark".
For example:
input:
ram
das
123
25.5
24.5
output:
ramdas 123 25.0*/
